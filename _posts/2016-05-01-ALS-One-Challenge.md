The ALS ONE Cycling Challenge is a 100 mile cycling event to raise awareness and monies for ALS ONE, the world's first 360 degree organization that brings together the best doctors, researchers, caregivers, and fundraisers!

What's an "old school" century?  It's a self-supported ride.  No SAG wagons, no extravagent rest stops, just good quality riding with your friends at your own pace.  This means you should be able to change your own tire, carry a cellphone, and most importantly be able to ride a bike for 5+ hours!!<!--more-->
