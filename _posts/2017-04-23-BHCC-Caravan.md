This weekend while returning from the Rasputitsa Spring Classic, the members of the Blue Hills Cycling Club set a Record for the number of times they had to stop and pee. "It started with a few post race beers at the Publick House" racer Scott Taylor explained - "Before you know it we  stopped at two Dunkin Donuts, a Cumberland Farms, The New Hampshire State Liquor Store and one final moment of relief at Andy's House", Andy could not be reached for comment.
